# Work-Day-Planner

A work day planner that uses javascript, jquery, moment.js and several bootstrap stylings for both the jumbotron and time slots
The timer uses a setinterval funtion and moment.js to keep up with current time
the user input is locally stored per row (time slot)
The time of day affects the color of the user input area, this is mainly controlled using if else statements and a comparison to the moment.js current time function
